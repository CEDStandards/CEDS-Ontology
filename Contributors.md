The CEDS Ontology work began in May of 2022 through a workgroup called the CEDS JSON/XML Workgroup. The establishment of this workgroup was the result of a ticket in the Open Source Community to develop JSON/XML schemas. The Mississippi Departmnt of Education, South Carolina Department of Education, and Michigan's Center for Educational Peformance and Information all indicated a need for develping JSON/XML standards for CEDS for various use cases within their organization. Through early meetings with the workgroup, the decision was made to create an ontology through which CEDS could be expressed in JSON, JSON-LD, XML, and many other machine readable languages. Multiple stakeholder organizations were involved in the workgroup and are listed below. (Apologies if we missed anyone, please email CEDS and we will get your organization added)
